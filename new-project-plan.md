# New Project Plan

## Project Name
[Cheap Signage Solutions (CSS)]

---

## Goal
What do you want to achieve?
I want that we create our own image to a rasberry pi. That will be a signage system. I want it to ask a bit of questions when you first boot so it can be setup corretly.
---

## Current Situation
Where are you now?
I have not started yet.
---

## Requirements
What does the project need?

- It needs a image that you can download from github and and extract to a sd card so it can be read via the rasberry.
- It also needs a dashboard. That can be downloaded and installed on whatever computer as long as it is in the same network. It needs to be a file that you can download via a msi installer or something like that. I want it to be good looking. It needs to be auto updating(from github(that we will create to thisn project.)) on reboot.

## Dashboard functions
Restart browser
Reboot the pie
Change the url (Also what url its showing)
See the runtime/cpu/memory/generally the whole stats of the pi
The user need to be able to change the name and place of the pi.
Bulk actions (Start restart all browsers), Change url of many pi at once. Reboot the whole systems 
Auto update from github.
Remove function
Add pi function
Be able to group different pi's together in "rooms"
It needs to autorefresh
A preveiew of what URL is showing on the pi.


## Each of the pi needs:
A browser with a changable url that will show 24/7 as a signage function
Auto restart once a day
Failsafe with a logo showing if it cant boot or is not able to get ethernet
It needs to be able to change the ip of the rasberry so we can get each pi in system if that is wanted.


## Approach
How will you build it?
I dont know yet.
---

## Steps
1. We will first create the agent running on the rasberry that has a kiosk signage look. It can be very simple- Just that everytime the pi restart it need to open the browser and show the URL we set it to show. And if the pi loses ethernet it need to show a logo.
